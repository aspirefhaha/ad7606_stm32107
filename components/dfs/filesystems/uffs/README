INTRODUCTION
------------

UFFS is a nand flash file system designed for embedded system.

UFFS have some unique and advanced features:
  * Low cost: e.g. it needs only 41K bytes RAM for 64MB NAND flash (page size 2048).
    
  * Fast booting: it reads only a few spares from each block, typically
    mounting a fully filled file system (Gbits) within one second.
    
  * Superb Reliability: 
    - The file system is designed for the embedded system which may 
        frequently lost power/reset without care.
    - Journal file system, the file system will automatically rollback
        to the last state when lost power on the middle of flash programing.
    - When 'write' return without error, the data is guarenteed been
        saved on flash.

  * Fast file create/read/write/seek.  
  * Bad-block tolerant, ECC enable and good ware-leveling.
  * There is no garbage collection needed for UFFS.
  * Support multiple NAND flash class in one system.
  * Support bare flash hardware, no operating system needed. 
  * Support static memory allocation (works without 'malloc').
  * Fully simulated on PC (Windows/Linux) platform.

Disadvantage:
  * space inefficency for small files: UFFS use at least one
   'block'(the minial erase unit for NAND flash, e.g. 16K ) for a file.
  * maximum supported blocks: 2^16 = 65535

Memory consuming example:
    For page size = 512:
        [VARY]Tree nodes: 16 * total_blocks 
        [CONST]Page Bufs: MAX_CACHED_BUFFERS(10) * (40 + pageSize(512)) = 5.4K 
        [CONST]Block Info caches: (24 + 14 * pages_per_block (32)) * MAX_CACHED_BLOCK_INFO (10) = 4.6K

        Example 1: 128M bytes NAND, 8192 blocks, total memory cost:
            (16 * 8192)128K + 5.4K + 4.6K = 138K bytes.
		
        Example 2: 32M Bytes NAND, 2048 blocks, total memory cost:
            (16 * 2048)32K + 5.4K + 4.6K = 42K bytes.
		
        Example 3: 16M bytes NAND, 1024 blocks, total memory cost:
            (16 * 1024)16K + 5.4K + 4.6K = 26K bytes.

    For page size = 2048:
        [VARY]Tree nodes: 16 * total_blocks 
        [CONST]Page Bufs: MAX_CACHED_BUFFERS(10) * (40 + pageSize(2048)) = 20.4K 
        [CONST]Block Info caches: (24 + 14 * pages_per_block (32)) * MAX_CACHED_BLOCK_INFO (10) = 4.6K

        Example 1: 512M bytes NAND, 8192 blocks, total memory cost:
            (16 * 8192)128K + 20.4K + 4.6K = 153K bytes.
		
        Example 2: 128M Bytes NAND, 2048 blocks, total memory cost:
            (16 * 2048)32K + 20.4K + 4.6K = 57K bytes.
		
        Example 3: 64M bytes NAND, 1024 blocks, total memory cost:
            (16 * 1024)16K + 20.4K + 4.6K = 41K bytes.
            

BUILD SIMULATOR REQUIREMENT
---------------------------
From V1.2.0, build uffs simulator requires 'cmake'.
'cmake' can be downloaded from: http://www.cmake.org/

or, under Debian/Ubuntu:
  sudo apt-get install cmake

BUILD SIMULATOR ON LINUX
------------------------
1) create a 'build' dir along with uffs source dir, for example:
/+
 +--build/
 +--uffs-1.2.0/
 |

2) create Makefiles and build:
  cd build
  cmake ../uffs-1.2.0
  make

5) run simulator (interactive mode):
  src/utils/mkuffs
 
 
BUILD SIMULATOR ON WINDOWS
--------------------------

1) create a 'build' dir along with uffs source dir,
/+
 +--build/
 +--uffs-1.2.0/
 |

2) Create VC project files:
  cd build
  cmake ../uffs-1.2.0

3) Open uffs.dsw (or uffs.sln for VC > 6 ), compile & run.

 
LATEST SOURCE CODE
------------------
You can get the latest source code from git repository:
  git clone git://uffs.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/uffs/uffs


CURRENT STATUS
--------------
UFFS 0.1.x is a working version on PC simulator, also has been ported to 
uBase embedded OS as a 'real world' product for thousands of copies,
it works fine so far.

UFFS 0.2.0 implementes full directory.

UFFS 1.0.0 is the first stable release at sf.net.

UFFS 1.1.0: support NAND flash with large page size (up to 2K).

UFFS 1.1.1: bug fixes. a tool for making uffs disk image.

UFFS 1.1.2: bug fixes. add more Flash Class. change Licence from GNU GPLv2 to GNU LGPLv2

UFFS 1.2.0: 
  - eliminate 'current path' and relatives. Now you should use absolute path in all
    uffs APIs. For dir, the fullname should end with '/'.
  - allow using static memory allocation, 'malloc' is no longer needed.
  - using cmake for building simulator.
  - bug fixes & minor changes.

UFFS 1.2.1:
  - improve bad block management
  - bug fixes
  - change Licence to modified GNU GPLv2.

UFFS 1.3.0:
  - improved flash interface
  - support hardware ECC
  - support user defined spare layout (for customized NAND flash controller)
  - support 4K page size
  - no partial page program required, support MLC NAND flash
  - reduced buffer flushes by grouping buffers
  - structual improvments and bug fixes
  
UFFS v1.3.1:
  - Tidy up three memory allocators: static, native and system.
  - Fix bugs in flash interface example.
  - Fix memory allocation bugs when using static memory allocator.
  - Add flash driver interface 'WriteFullPage()'.
  - Fix compilation errors for BlackFin DSP compiler.

UFFS v1.3.2:
  - Add POSIX like file system APIs.
  - Bug fixes.
